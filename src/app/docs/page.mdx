# Installation

This project is built using the `shadcn@latest` CLI to distribute the components.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

the above command expects tailwind to be installed in the project.

## Adding Carbon

Follow the instructions in the [Carbon Tailwind](https://carbon.sage.com/docs/tailwind) documentation.


### Installing manually

If you are working on a Next.js project, you can only use turbopack importing the .css file, if you want to work with the .scss file you need to remove turbopack


### Adding Styles

Make sure you import the Carbon Styles before tailwind so the overrides work without using important

```tsx
import "@carbon/styles/css/styles.css";
import "./globals.css";
```
